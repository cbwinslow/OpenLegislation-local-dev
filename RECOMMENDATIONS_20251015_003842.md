## Recommendations (2025-10-15 00:38:42 UTC)

1. Configure CI to run static type checks (e.g., `mypy`) and linting on the new `tools/data_pipeline` package to catch integration issues early.
2. Add automated integration tests that hit mocked API endpoints to validate serialization and database writes without relying on live external services.
3. Consider containerizing the ingestion workflow (Docker + docker-compose) so operators can run scheduled jobs with consistent dependencies.
4. Schedule recurring cron or Airflow DAGs leveraging the new scripts to keep the PostgreSQL warehouse synchronized with upstream sources.
