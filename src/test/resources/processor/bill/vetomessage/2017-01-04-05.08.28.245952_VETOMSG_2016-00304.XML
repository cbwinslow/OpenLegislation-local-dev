                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 304

TO THE SENATE:

I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:

Senate Bill Number 6906, entitled:

    "AN  ACT  to amend the public authorities law, the general municipal
      law, the public service law and the state finance law, in relation
      to notice provisions in public works contracts"

    NOT APPROVED

  This bill would require that any contract made and awarded by a public
owner for any public works project  include  a  provision  that:  (i)  a
contractor's or claimant's failure to give notice within 180 days of the
time  prescribed  in the contract shall not invalidate any claim; unless
(ii) the public owner can demonstrate that it was materially  prejudiced
by the claimant's failure to provide timely notice.

  Appropriate  notice provisions in public works contracts permit public
owners to manage projects more efficiently. They also ensure that infor-
mation is promptly provided to stakeholders if necessary to  evaluate  a
change order or to resolve a problem on a project.

  This bill would fundamentally alter well-established notice provisions
that  ensure  that public works projects are timely completed and "avoid
the waste of public funds." A.H.A. General Construction, Inc.  v.    New
                            ____________________________________________

Group, Inc. v. State of New York, 123 A.D.3d 1311 (2014). Not only would
________________________________
these provisions eliminate a public owner's ability to mitigate  project
delays and adhere to planned work schedules, but it would require public
owners  to  accept  and  pay for work that was unnecessary and otherwise
unauthorized. Moreover, litigating whether a public owner has been mate-
rially prejudiced will undoubtedly lead to increased claims  and  costs.
For these reasons, I am therefore constrained to veto this bill.

  However,  I  recognize that State agencies and authorities do not have
standardized notice and forfeiture  provisions  and  that  the  lack  of
uniformity may cause confusion for contractors, particularly small busi-
ness  owners.  I am therefore directing the Council of Contracting Agen-
cies ("CCA") to review the notice  and  forfeiture  provisions  for  all
State  public works contracts to assess the feasibility of standardizing
those provisions and to issue a report with their  proposed  recommenda-
tions no later than September 1, 2017.

  This bill is disapproved.                   (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
