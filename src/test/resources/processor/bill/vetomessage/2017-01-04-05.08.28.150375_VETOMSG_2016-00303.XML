                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 303

TO THE SENATE:

I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:

Senate Bill Number 6369 entitled:

    "AN  ACT  to amend the tax law and the insurance law, in relation to
      credits for premiums paid for long-term care insurance policies"

    NOT APPROVED

  This bill would extend the long-term  care  insurance  tax  credit  to
include a 20% credit for any premiums paid toward a life insurance poli-
cy that has an accelerated death benefit rider.

  For many individuals, long-term care insurance is a critical financial
tool  to  ensure  adequate  coverage for long-term personal or custodial
care. My Administration has taken substantial steps to support  individ-
uals  in  need  of long term care, including the Department of Financial
Services' collaborative efforts to work with consumers and the insurance
industry to establish standards for long term care  insurance  products.
More  recently, additional funding was allocated to the State's Expanded
In-Home Services for the Elderly  Program,  a  partnership  between  the
state  and  the counties to provide non-medical services and support for
seniors who require help with basic daily activities.

  I continue to support the need to  provide  additional  assistance  to
individuals  in  need of long term care. However, this bill suffers from
the same fundamental flaw as the bill I vetoed last year (Veto  No.  268
of  2015)  --  it  does  not  identify a designated source of funding to
offset the significant cost of providing a tax credit for premiums  paid
for  long-term  care  insurance  policies. Such funding decisions should
occur in the context of the annual budget negotiations.

  Thus, while I am constrained to veto this bill,  I  am  directing  the
Department  of  Financial  Services to work with the bill's sponsors and
interested stakeholders to develop recommendations to address the impor-
tant policy goals advanced by this legislation in a fiscally responsible
manner.

  This bill is disapproved.                   (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
