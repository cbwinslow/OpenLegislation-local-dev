                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 302

TO THE SENATE:

I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:

Senate Bill Number 4237-A, entitled:

    "AN  ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to vendor fees at certain
      vendor tracks"

    NOT APPROVED

  This bill would allow facilities within 40 miles of a Native  American
Class III casino to receive a 41% commission rate, increasing the thres-
hold distance up from 15 miles.

  My  Administration has supported destination gaming as it is an impor-
tant part of New York's tourism industry. However, any decisions regard-
ing a casino's commission rate, both in terms of revenue  available  and
the  potential  impact  on the State's financial plan, have always been,
and should continue to be, addressed in the context of the annual budget
negotiations. I am therefore constrained to veto this bill.

  This bill is disapproved.                   (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO

                               __________
