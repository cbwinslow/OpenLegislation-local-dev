                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 301

TO THE SENATE:

I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:

Senate Bill Number 2691, entitled:

    "AN  ACT  to amend the social services law, in relation to directing
      the office of children and family services to  establish  workload
      standards for child protective services workers"

    NOT APPROVED

  This  bill  would  require  the Office of Children and Family Services
(OCFS) to establish caseload standards for full  time  child  protective
service (CPS) workers that would not exceed 15 active cases per month.

  It  is undisputed that CPS workers are on the frontlines of protecting
the State's children against instances of abuse and neglect, and I fully
support the sponsors' goal to limit CPS caseloads to ensure high-quality
investigations. In 2014, however, I was constrained to veto a bill  that
would require each local social services district to gather, prepare and
report on extensive monthly data regarding CPS staff members, caseloads,
hirings,  resignations,  and  terminations.  (Veto  No. 577 of 2014). In
doing so, I noted that the reports would not provide information  neces-
sary  to  establish a caseload standard because it would not account for
variables that would impact the number of cases  that  each  CPS  worker
could  handle.  This  includes, but is not limited to, the nature of the
allegations, the complexity of each case, and the number of children  in
a household.

  This  bill would go one step further, and require OCFS to set an arbi-
trary monthly caseload standard. However the State cannot blindly  adopt
a   one-size-fits  all  approach  without  a  comprehensive  study  that
addresses all of the factors identified above. Moreover, imposing  case-
load  standards  without  flexibility  may  result in CPS investigations
being  rushed  or  closed  prematurely  to  keep  a  worker  within  the
prescribed caseloads.

  Finally,  any  legislation seeking to mandate a caseload standard must
include adequate funding.  Otherwise,  the  intent  of  the  legislation
cannot  be  realized  and  it will instead impose a significant unfunded
mandate on  local  county  governments  and  ultimately  all  taxpayers.
Because  this  bill  fails  to  include  an  appropriation sufficient to
support this proposal, I am therefore constrained to veto this bill.

  In the interim, I am directing OCFS to work with the bill's  sponsors,
county  officials,  and  interested stakeholders to make recommendations
for conducting a statewide study that  considers  the  factors  outlined
above,  including  whether  it  would be appropriate to impose mandatory
caseload or workload standards.

  This bill is disapproved.                   (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
