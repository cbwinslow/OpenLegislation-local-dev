<B><U>TITLE OF BILL</U></B>:  An act to amend the administrative code of the city of
New York, the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four
and the emergency housing rent control law in relation to approval of
major capital improvement rent increases and in relation to extending
the length of time over which major capital improvement expenses may be
recovered

&nbsp
<B><U>PURPOSE</U></B>:

This bill establishes a regulatory framework for the approval of rent
increases to rent regulated property as a result of major capital
improvements (MCIs). Currently, the expenses for MCIs are recovered over
seven years. This bill codifies the MCI as a surcharge to the legal
regulated rent which is separately designated and billed as such, and
mandates that the surcharge for authorized MCIs ceases after the cost of
the improvement is recouped. Finally, this bill prevents landlords from
receiving a financial windfall by charging MCIs to tenants, if an MCI is
funded by the New York State Energy and Development Authority (NYSERDA).

&nbsp
<B><U>SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS</U></B>:

This legislation establishes criteria for the approval of rent increases
to rent regulated property resulting from major capital improvements
(MCIs), and guards against potential abuses.

Section 1 of the bill amends subparagraph (g) of paragraph 1 of subdivi-
sion g of section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New
York, as amended by section 31 chapter 20 of the laws of 2015, to permit
for the individual adjustment of maximum rents in the case of an MCI
where the State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner first finds
that an improvement is depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and
is required for the operation or preservation of the structure. However,
no MCI rent increases will be approved by the division of housing and
community renewal (DHCR) unless the work performed is an enhancement or
upgrade, or is an addition to such housing accommodation. Any repair or
replacement intended to maintain an existing service is ineligible. If
any outstanding hazardous violations exist, no MCI rent increase appli-
cation will be approved unless DHCR determines that such work is essen-
tial to the alleviation of the violations and such approval is consist-
ent with this section. Except in cases of emergency or good cause, the
property owner will file an application and affidavit with DHCR contain-
ing specific information about the scope of the work to be done and
information about the owners of the property, in cluding a statement
confirming that no owners have been found to have harassed or unlawfully
evicted tenants in the five years prior to the MCI. DHCR will then
provide the occupying tenants with such information and will elicit
tenant comments to determine whether the work has been satisfactorily
completed. No MCI rent increase shall become effective until any defec-
tive or deficient rehabilitation work has been cured.

The increase permitted for MCIs shall be collected as a separately
designated monthly surcharge to the maximum rent that shall not be
compounded by any other adjustments. The surcharge allocable to each
apartment shall be an amount equal to the cost of the improvement
divided by eighty-four, divided by the number of rooms in the building,
and then multiplied by the number of rooms in such apartment. However,
the surcharge to any apartment in any year• may not exceed six percent
of the monthly rent collected by the owner for such apartment. Any
excess shall be carried forward and collected in future years. The
collection of surcharges for MCIs shall cease when the owner has
recouped the costs attributable to the MCI.

Section 2 of the bill amends subparagraph (k) of paragraph 1 of subdivi-
sion g of section 26-405 of the administrative code of the City of New
York, as amended by chapter 749 of the laws of 1990.  Where a landlord
has incurred other expenditures of 10% or greater in connection with and
in.addition to a concurrent adjustment for an MCI, additional adjust-
ments shall be implemented in the same manner as such MCI, as a further
surcharge to the maximum rent.

Section 3 of the bill amends paragraph 6 of subdivision c of section
26-511 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended by
Section 29 of part A of the laws of 2015. This section removes an exist-
ing requirement that the cost for completed building-wide MCIs be "amor-
tized over a seven-year period", insofar as the interpretation of that
term has departed from its ordinary meaning, misconstruing the intent of
the statute.

Section 4 of the bill amends subdivision c of section 26-511 of the
administrative code of the city of New York, by adding three new para-
graphs 6-b, 6-c and 6-d. These paragraphs provide criteria for approving
MCI applications, as follows:

Paragraph 6-b provides that the Commissioner must first finds that an
improvement is depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and is
required for the operation or preservation of the structure. However, no
MCI rent increases will be approved by the division of housing and
community renewal (DHCR) unless the work performed is an enhancement or
upgrade, or is an addition to such housing accommodation. Any repair or
replacement intended to maintain an existing service is ineligible. If
any outstanding hazardous violations exist, no MCI rent increase appli-
cation will be approved unless DHCR determines that such work is essen-
tial to the alleviation of the violations and such approval is consist-
ent with these provisions. Except in cases of emergency or good cause,
the property owner will file an application and affidavit with DHCR
containing specific information about the scope of the work to be done
and information about the owners of the property, including a statement
confirming that no owners have been found to have harassed or unlawfully
evicted tenants in the five years prior to applying for the MCI. DHCR
will then provide the occupying tenants with such information and will
elicit tenant comments to determine whether the work has been satisfac-
torily completed. No major capital improvement rent increase shall
become effective until any defective or deficient rehabilitation work
has been cured.

Paragraph 6-c provides that the increase permitted for MCIs shall be
collected as a separately designated monthly surcharge to the maximum
rent that shall not be compounded by any annual adjustment of the level
of fair rent provided for under subdivision b of section 26-510 of this
law. The surcharge allocable to each apartment shall be an amount equal
to the cost of the improvement divided by eighty-four, divided by the
number of rooms in the building, and then multiplied by the number of
rooms in such apartment. However, the surcharge to any apartment in any
year may not exceed six percent of the monthly rent collected by the
owner for such apartment. Any excess shall be carried forward and
collected in future years.

Paragraph 6-d ensures that the collection of surcharges for MCIs, as
provided for in paragraphs 6-b and 6-c of this subdivision, shall cease
when the owner has recouped the costs attributable to the MCI.

Section 5 of the bill amends paragraph 3 of subdivision d of section 6
of section 4 of chapter 576 of the laws of 1974 (known as the Emergency
Tenant Protection Act of 1974), as amended by section 30 of part A of
Chapter 20 of the Laws of 2015 to permit an MCI where the State Homes
and Community Renewal Commissioner first finds that an improvement is
depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and is required for the
operation or preservation of the structure. However, no MCI rent
increases will be approved by DHCR unless the work performed is an
enhancement or upgrade, or is an addition to such housing accommodation.
Any repair or replacement intended to maintain an existing service is
ineligible. If any outstand- ing hazardous violations exist, no MCI rent
increase application will be approved unless DHCR determines that such
work is essential to the alle- viation of the violations and such
approval is consistent with this section. Except in cases of emergency
or good cause, the property owner will file an application and affidavit
with DHCR containing specific information about the scope of the work to
be done and information about the owners of the property, including a
statement confirming that no owners have been found to ha ve harassed or
unlawfully evicted tenants in the five years prior to the MCI. DHCR will
then provide the occupying tenants with such information and will elicit
tenant comments to deter- mine whether the work has been satisfactorily
completed. No MCI increase shall become effective until any defective or
deficient rehabilitation work has been cured.

The increase permitted for MCIs shall be collected as a separately
designated monthly surcharge to the maximum rent that shall not be
compounded by any annual rent adjustment authorized by the Rent Guide-
lines Board (RGB). The surcharge allocable to each apartment shall be an
amount equal to the cost of the improvement divided by eighty-four,
divided by the number of rooms in the building, and then multiplied by
the number of rooms in such apartment. However, the surcharge to any
apartment in any year may not exceed six percent of the monthly rent
collected by the owner for such apartment. Any excess shall be carried
forward and collected in future years. The collection of surcharges for
MCIs shall cease when the owner has recouped the costs attributable to
the MCI.

Section 6 of the bill amends the second undesignated paragraph of para-
graph (a) of subdivision 4 of section 4 of chapter 274 of the laws of
1946 (known as the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law), as amended by
section 25 of part B of chapter 97 of the laws of 2011, to permit an MCI
where the State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner first finds
that an improvement is depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and
is required for the operation or preservation of the structure. However,
no MCI rent increases will be approved by DHCR unless the work performed
is an enhancement or upgrade, or is an addition to such housing accommo-
dation. Any repair or replacement intended to maintain an existing
service is ineligible. If any outstanding hazardous violations exist, no
MCI rent increase application will be approved unless DHCR determines
that such work is essential to the alleviation of the violations and
such approval is consistent with this section. Except in cases of emer-
gency or good cause, the property owner will file an application and
affidavit with DHCR containing specific information about the scope of
the work to be done and information about the owners of the property,
including a statement confirming that no owners hav e been found to have
harassed or unlawfully evicted tenants in the five years prior to the
MCI. DHCR will then provide the occupying tenants with such information
and will elicit tenant comments to determine whether the work has been
satisfactorily completed. No MCI increase shall become effective until
any defective or deficient rehabilitation work has been cured.

The increase permitted for MCIs shall be collected as a separately
designated monthly surcharge to the maximum rent that shall not be
compounded by any other adjustment to the maximum rent. The surcharge
allocable to each apartment shall be an amount equal to the cost of the
improvement divided by eighty-four, divided by the number of rooms in
the building, and then multiplied by the number of rooms in such apart-
ment. However, the surcharge to any apartment in any year may not exceed
six percent of the monthly rent collected by the owner for such apart-
ment. Any excess shall be carried forward and collected in future years.
The collection of surcharges for MCIs shall cease when the owner has
recouped the costs attributable to the MCI.

Section 7 of the bill amends paragraph 5 of subdivision d of section 6
of section 4 of chapter 576 of the laws added.of 1974 and a new para-
graph 6 is added.

Section 8 of the bill amends paragraph 1 of subdivision g of section
26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York by adding a
new subparagraph (p), to prohibit adjustments for any MCIs or for any
other expenditures to improve, restore or preserve the quality of a
structure if such MCI is a project funded by the New York State Energy
Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) .

Section 9 of the bill sets forth the effective date.

&nbsp
<B><U>JUSTIFICATION:</U></B>

In 1989, the Court of Appeals held that building owners could increase
rent levels in perpetuity based on major capital improvements (MCIs) to
their buildings, with the result that tenants are forced to pay for
these improvements long after costs have been fully recovered, and even
after they have outlived their useful life. Ansonia Residents Assn v.
DHCR, 75 N.Y.2d 206, 551 N.Y.S.2d 871 (1989). This is because the MCI
"amortization period", which ordinarily refers to the spreading out and
paying off of capital expenses in regular installments over a specific
period of time, can instead serve as a tactic for boosting rent levels
forever.

Unfortunately, many landlords utilize MCI charges as an unscrupulous
means to raise the rent of their units above the legal maximum rent,
unfairly burdening their tenants, circumventing the rent regulations,
and edging their apartments out of rent regulation. To guard against
this, this legislation requires applicants to submit a statement
confirming that no owners have been found to have harassed or unlawfully
evicted tenants in the prior five years.

Moreover, according to an audit issued by the Comptroller of the City of
New York, "allegations made in a series of recent judicial proceedings
suggest that there is a perception of fraudulent activity associated
with MCI and IAI rent increases." The Growing Gap: New York City's Hous-
ing Affordability Challenge, Office of the New York City Comptroller 22,
April 2014, comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Growing
Gap.pdf.  Although some MCI charges are legitimate, many landlords are
granted MCI charges for work that is simply routine maintenance, and not
an actual improvement. This is not the intent of the MCI program, which
grew out of 1970s-era concerns that landlords needed to be incentivized
to invest in their buildings. Under the current MCI program, landlords
may be incentivized to do the opposite. Though this may lead to larger
cost down the road, landlords may prefer this course of action because
regular maintenance cannot be covered by an MCI, but a major overhaul
necessitated by deferred repairs can be covered. This legislation clari-
fies that MCIs will only be approved if the work performed is an
enhancement, upgrade, or addition, while repairs or replacements
intended to maintain existing services are ineligible. Also, MCI appli-
cations will not be approved where outstanding hazardous violations
exist, unless DHCR finds that such work is essential to the alleviation
of the violations.

This bill also delineates a better process of consultation between DHCR,
the landlord-applicant, and the existing tenants. According to media
reports, until the creation of the Tenant Protection Unit (TPU) in 2012,
the oversight process was "exclusively complaint-driven, meaning the
onus fell on tenants to prove an owner's application was incorrect,
misleading, or even fraudulent. Jillian Jones, Tenants Rip Program Tying
Rent Hikes to landlord Investments, City Limits, Dec.  19, 2014,
http://citylimits.org/2014/12/19/tenants-rip-program- tving-rent-hikes-
to-landlordinvestments/. This legislation requires that applicants
submit specific information about the scope of the work to be done and
information about the owners of the property.  DHCR will then provide
occupying tenants with this information and will elicit tenant feedback
to determine whether the work has been completed. No MCIs will be made
effective until deficient work has been cured.

In addition, MCIs such as window replacements or heating-system improve-
ments create energy savings that further increase the profitability of
MCIs. Apart from MCI surcharges approved by DHCR, the NYSERDA Multifami-
ly Performance Program offers landlords incentives to invest in energy-
efficient building upgrades, including implementing environmentally
friendly measures to address specific energy and operational needs of
buildings. In many cases, landlords have filed applications with both
DHCR and NYSERDA for the imposition of MCI charges for capital work that
fall within NYSERDA's jurisdiction for receiving funds. This practice of
double-dipping, wherein a landlord takes advantage of two different
incentive programs for the same work, violates the intent of these
provisions and, if permitted, results in a windfall to landlords. This
bill clarifies that such double-dipping is not permitted.

For the foregoing reasons, the lack of statutory criteria to guide the
division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) in its MCI application
determinations is a major source of the problem. In response, this bill
seeks to balance the conflicting concerns of maintaining affordable
housing while ensuring that adequate incentives exist for investment in
MCIs, in order to preserve and improve our affordable housing stock. To
do so, this legislation provides such criteria to prevent abuse.and
includes safeguards
