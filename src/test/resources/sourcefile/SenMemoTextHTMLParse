<B><U>SPONSOR:</U></B> BONACIC<BR>
&nbsp
<B><U>TITLE OF BILL</U></B>:  An act to amend the civil practice law and rules, in
relation to out of state hospital records produced pursuant to subpoena

&nbsp
<B><U>PURPOSE OF BILL</U></B>:

The bill would amend the Civil Practice Law and Rules to simplify the
procedures by which hospital records located outside of New York State
may be admitted into evidence in civil actions.

&nbsp
<B><U>SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS</U></B>:

Subdivision (c) of Rule 4518 of the civil practice law and rules is
amended by this bill, admissible as evidence in civil actions if the
records are certified or authenticated by the head of the hospital,
laboratory, department or bureau of a municipal corporation or of the
state, or by an employee delegated for that purpose or by a qualified
physician.

&nbsp
<B><U>JUSTIFICATION</U></B>:

In many kinds of litigation hospital records provide crucial evidence,
either of the harm suffered by the plaintiff or of the events in
dispute. Under existing law, hospital records are admissible into
evidence if either the custodian of the records testifies in court as to
certain specific foundational facts indicating the records' authenticity
and reliability, or if the custodian provides a written certification
setting forth the same foundational requirements.

For a custodian of hospital records located outside of New York, provid-
ing oral testimony can be difficult or impossible. Parties to litigation
therefore rely on written certification to allow records to be brought
into evidence. However, obtaining a written certification that meets New
York's specific procedural requirements can be problematic, particularly
if a custodian of those records is unfamiliar with New York rules.

This bill will ease these procedural difficulties for all parties to
litigation by allowing hospital records located outside New York to be
certified in accordance with either the existing New York rules, or the
rules of the jurisdiction where the records are located and that a
custodian of records is likely to understand and comply with routinely.

Existing New York Statutes, including but not limited to CPLR 4543, 3122
and 3122-a provide an instructive framework for these procedures.
