   40  for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
   41  malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
   42  [2017] 2018; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
   43  of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
   44  in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
   45  2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
   46  accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
   47  utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
   48  insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
   49  monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
   50  and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
   51  a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
   52  attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
   53  for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
   54  not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [2017]
   55  2018, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
   56  ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual

       A. 3007--A                         75

    1  surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
    2  to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
    3  surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
    4  2010.  On  and  after  July  1,  1989,  the surcharge prescribed by this
    5  section shall be retained by insurers to the extent  that  they  insured
    6  physicians  and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30, [2017]
    7  2018 policy periods; in the event  and  to  the  extent  physicians  and
    8  surgeons  were  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a
    9  pro rata share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall  be  remitted
   10  to  such  other  insurer  in accordance with rules and regulations to be
   11  promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
   12  and surgeons who were not insured during such policy  periods  shall  be
   13  apportioned  among  all insurers in proportion to the premium written by
   14  each insurer during such policy periods; if a physician or  surgeon  was
   15  insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
   16  during  such  policy  periods,  and  at  any time thereafter a hospital,
   17  health maintenance organization, employer or institution is  responsible
   18  for  responding in damages for liability arising out of such physician's
   19  or surgeon's practice of medicine, such responsible  entity  shall  also
   20  remit  to  such  prior  insurer the equivalent amount that would then be
   21  collected as a surcharge if the physician or surgeon  had  continued  to
   22  remain  insured  by  such  prior  insurer. In the event any insurer that
   23  provided coverage during such policy  periods  is  in  liquidation,  the
   24  property/casualty  insurance  security fund shall receive the portion of
   25  surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
   26  The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
   27  the purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The  superintendent,
   28  in  establishing  adequate  rates and in determining any projected defi-
   29  ciency pursuant to the requirements of this section  and  the  insurance
   30  law,  shall  give  substantial  weight, determined in his discretion and
   31  judgment, to the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of  any  regulations
   32  promulgated  and  laws  enacted  and the public benefit of   stabilizing
   33  malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
   34  od of time necessary for the development of  more  reliable  statistical
   35  experience  as  to  the  efficacy of such laws and regulations affecting
   36  medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
   37  1986, by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any  provision
   38  of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
   39  the  superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if such
   40  rates would be adequate when taken together with the maximum  authorized
   41  annual  surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time whether
   42  or not any such annual surcharge has been actually  imposed  as  of  the
   43  establishment of such rates.

   43  prospective  enrollee  in  such  program  CONSISTENT  WITH SECTION THREE
   44  HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-A OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW.  This assessment  shall
   45  also  serve  as the basis for the development and provision of an appro-
   46  priate plan of care for the enrollee. Upon approval of  federal  waivers
   47  pursuant  to  paragraph  (b)  of  this subdivision which require medical
   48  assistance  recipients  who  require  community-based  long  term   care

   51  nity-based  services  and  complete  the comprehensive assessment within
   52  thirty days of enrollment provided that  the  plan  continues  to  cover
   53  transitional care until such time as the assessment is completed.
   54    (ii)  The  assessment  shall  be  completed by a representative of the
   55  managed long term care plan or demonstration, in consultation  with  the
   56  prospective  enrollee's  health  care  practitioner  as  necessary.  The

       A. 3007--A                         87

    1  commissioner shall prescribe the forms on which the assessment shall  be

    6  term care plan or demonstration. Enrollments  conducted  by  a  plan  or

    8  a contractor selected pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subdivision.
    9    (iv) Continued enrollment in a managed long term care plan  or  demon-
   10  stration  paid  for by government funds shall be based upon a comprehen-
   11  sive assessment [of the medical, social and environmental needs] of  the
   12  recipient   of  the  services  CONSISTENT  WITH  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED
   13  SIXTY-FIVE-A OF THIS SOCIAL SERVICES LAW.    Such  assessment  shall  be
   14  performed  at  least every six months by the managed long term care plan

   18  for medical assistance. The commissioner shall establish  payment  rates
   19  for  services  provided  to  enrollees  eligible  under title XIX of the
   20  federal social security act. Such payment  rates  shall  be  subject  to
   21  approval by the director of the division of the budget and shall reflect
   22  savings to both state and local governments when compared to costs which
   23  would  be incurred by such program if enrollees were to receive compara-
   24  ble health and long term care services on a fee-for-service basis in the
   25  geographic region in which such services are proposed  to  be  provided.
   26  Payment rates shall be risk-adjusted to take into account the character-
   27  istics  of  enrollees, or proposed enrollees, including, but not limited
   28  to:   frailty, disability level,  health  and  functional  status,  age,
   29  gender,  the  nature  of  services provided to such enrollees, and other
   30  factors as determined by the commissioner. The  risk  adjusted  premiums
   31  may  also  be  combined  with  disincentives or requirements designed to
   32  mitigate any incentives to obtain higher payment categories. In  setting
   33  such  payment  rates, the commissioner shall consider costs borne by the
   34  managed care program to ensure actuarially sound and adequate  rates  of
   35  payment  to  ensure quality of care [shall comply] AND THE COSTS ASSOCI-
   36  ATED WITH COMPLIANCE with all applicable laws and regulations, state and
   37  federal, including [regulations as to], BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RELAT-
   38  ING TO WAGES, LABOR AND actuarial soundness [for medicaid managed care].

   48  prospective enrollee in  such  program  CONSISTENT  WITH  SECTION  THREE
   49  HUNDRED  SIXTY-FIVE-A  OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW. This assessment shall
   50  also serve as the basis for the development and provision of  an  appro-
