     9  the total number of clinical research positions in the region  does  not
    10  exceed  the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph. If
    11  the repeated reduction of the total number of  clinical  research  posi-
    12  tions  in  the region by one-half does not render a total funding amount
    13  that is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that  region
    14  within  the  appropriation, the funding for each clinical research posi-
    15  tion in that region shall be  reduced  proportionally  in  one  thousand

    17  clinical research positions in that region does  not  exceed  the  total
    18  amount  reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any reduction
    19  in funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No  clinical
    20  research  positions that continue from and were funded in prior distrib-
    21  ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.

    39  clause (G) of this subparagraph must be completed by the  consortium  or
    40  teaching general hospital in order for the consortium or teaching gener-
    41  al  hospital to be eligible to apply for ECRIP funding in any subsequent

    45  dollars  to  primarily  fund  salary and fringe benefits of the clinical
    46  research position with the remainder going to fund  the  development  of
    47  faculty  who  are involved in biomedical research, training and clinical
    48  care.

    40    &#167;  2. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 1112 to
    41  read as follows:
    42    <B><U>&#167; 1112. Emerging contaminant monitoring. 1. Industry and modern  tech-</U></B>
    43  <B><U>nology  have created thousands of new chemicals that would not otherwise</U></B>
    44  <B><U>exist in nature. Although some of these chemicals have proven  benefits,</U></B>
    45  <B><U>the  effect  of  many  such  chemicals on human health is unknown or not</U></B>
    46  <B><U>fully understood. Furthermore, with the advance of science and technolo-</U></B>
    47  <B><U>gy, public health scientists and experts are able to identify  naturally</U></B>
    48  <B><U>occurring  contaminants  that  pose  previously unknown hazards to human</U></B>
    49  <B><U>health. Where these chemicals or contaminants, collectively referred  to</U></B>
    50  <B><U>as  "emerging  contaminants,"  enter  drinking  water supplies, they can</U></B>
    51  <B><U>present unknown but potentially serious risks to  public  health.    New</U></B>

     1  <B><U>potentially hazardous substances contaminate their  drinking  water  and</U></B>
     2  <B><U>the  department  must be equipped to monitor and protect the public from</U></B>
     3  <B><U>these emerging contaminants.</U></B>
     4    <B><U>2.  a.  "Emerging  contaminants"  shall  mean  any physical, chemical,</U></B>
     5  <B><U>microbiological or radiological substance listed as an emerging  contam-</U></B>
     6  <B><U>inant pursuant to  subdivision three of this section.</U></B>
     7    <B><U>b.  "Notification  level"  shall  mean  the  concentration level of an</U></B>
     8  <B><U>emerging contaminant in drinking water that the commissioner has  deter-</U></B>
     9  <B><U>mined,  based  on  available  scientific  information,  to  be linked to</U></B>
    10  <B><U>adverse health outcomes including both physical and  behavioral  health,</U></B>
    11  <B><U>and warrants public notification pursuant to this section.</U></B>
    12    <B><U>c.  "Covered  public  water  system"  shall mean:   (i) a public water</U></B>
    13  <B><U>system that serves at least five service connections used by  year-round</U></B>
    14  <B><U>residents or regularly serves at least twenty-five year-round residents;</U></B>
    15  <B><U>(ii) a public water system that regularly serves at least twenty-five of</U></B>
    16  <B><U>the  same  people, four hours or more per day, for four or more days per</U></B>
    17  <B><U>week, for twenty-six or more weeks per year; or (iii) any other substan-</U></B>
    18  <B><U>tially similar water system as determined by the commissioner.</U></B>
    19    <B><U>3. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations to identify and  list</U></B>
    20  <B><U>substances  as  emerging  contaminants.  In  determining what substances</U></B>
    21  <B><U>shall be identified as emerging contaminants the commissioner shall,  at</U></B>
    22  <B><U>a minimum, examine substances that require regulation or monitoring when</U></B>
    23  <B><U>present  in  drinking  water in other jurisdictions outside the state of</U></B>
    24  <B><U>New York; the United  States  environmental  protection  agency's  human</U></B>

    29  <B><U>tified as emerging contaminants: 1,4-dioxane; vanadium; strontium; chro-</U></B>
    30  <B><U>mium-6; chlorate; perfluorooctanesulfonic  acid;  and  perfluorooctanoic</U></B>
    31  <B><U>acid.  Additional  substances  to be identified as emerging contaminants</U></B>
    32  <B><U>shall meet the following criteria:</U></B>
    33    <B><U>a. are not subject to  any  other  substance-specific  drinking  water</U></B>
    34  <B><U>regulation  of  the  department  that  establishes a maximum contaminant</U></B>
    35  <B><U>level, or other legally established threshold concentration used by  the</U></B>
    36  <B><U>department that requires public notification or remedial action;</U></B>
    37    <B><U>b. are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems; and</U></B>
    38    <B><U>c.  because of their quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical or</U></B>
    39  <B><U>infectious characteristics, may cause physical  injury  or  illness,  or</U></B>

    41  <B><U>ing water.</U></B>
    42    <B><U>4. Every covered public water system shall test drinking water for the</U></B>
    43  <B><U>presence  of  emerging contaminants in the state and unregulated contam-</U></B>
    44  <B><U>inants monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water  Act  as  amended</U></B>
    45  <B><U>from time to time, at least once every three years in a manner and time-</U></B>
    46  <B><U>frame established by the department through regulation.</U></B>
    47    <B><U>5.  Every  test  conducted  in  accordance  with this section shall be</U></B>
    48  <B><U>conducted by a  laboratory  certified  by  the  department  pursuant  to</U></B>
    49  <B><U>section five hundred two of this chapter. Laboratories shall submit such</U></B>

     2  <B><U>remedial action for that substance.</U></B>
     3    <B><U>7.  Whenever  one or more emerging contaminants is present in drinking</U></B>
     4  <B><U>water at concentrations at or above  a  notification  level  established</U></B>
     5  <B><U>pursuant  to  this  section the covered public water system shall notify</U></B>
     6  <B><U>all owners of real property served by the covered public water system in</U></B>
     7  <B><U>a time and manner to be prescribed  by  the  department.    Such  public</U></B>
     8  <B><U>notification  shall  occur  within thirty days. The covered public water</U></B>
     9  <B><U>system shall consult with the department  within  twenty-four  hours  of</U></B>
    10  <B><U>being  notified  of the presence of an emerging contaminant. The depart-</U></B>
    11  <B><U>ment may reduce the timeframe for public notification from  thirty  days</U></B>
    12  <B><U>if  it  is determined that the public's interest would be best served by</U></B>
    13  <B><U>such reduction. The commissioner may directly notify such owners of real</U></B>
    14  <B><U>property if it is determined that the public's interest  would  be  best</U></B>
    15  <B><U>served  by such notification, or if the commissioner determines that the</U></B>
    16  <B><U>covered public water system is not acting, or cannot  act  in  a  timely</U></B>
    17  <B><U>manner.</U></B>
    18    <B><U>8.  The  commissioner may require that the covered public water system</U></B>
    19  <B><U>take such actions as may be appropriate to reduce exposure  to  emerging</U></B>
    20  <B><U>contaminants.  The  commissioner  shall  work  in  consultation with the</U></B>
    21  <B><U>commissioner of the department of environmental conservation to  develop</U></B>
    22  <B><U>educational  materials,  which  shall  be  made available to the covered</U></B>
    23  <B><U>public water system and the general public,  relating  to  methodologies</U></B>
    24  <B><U>for  reducing  exposure  to  emerging contaminants and potential actions</U></B>
    25  <B><U>that may be taken to remediate emerging contaminants.  The  commissioner</U></B>
    26  <B><U>shall  also  provide  the  covered  public water system with information</U></B>
    27  <B><U>relating to potential funding sources provided by the state and  federal</U></B>
    28  <B><U>government for remedial activities, and to reduce the exposure to emerg-</U></B>
    29  <B><U>ing  contaminants.  Whenever  the  commissioner of health has required a</U></B>
    30  <B><U>public water system to  take  action  to  reduce  exposure  to  emerging</U></B>
    31  <B><U>contaminants,  the  department shall undertake all reasonable and neces-</U></B>
    32  <B><U>sary measures to ensure that safe drinking water is  expeditiously  made</U></B>
    33  <B><U>available  to  all  people  in  any  area of the state in which emerging</U></B>
    34  <B><U>contaminants are known to be present. Such  area  shall  include,  at  a</U></B>
    35  <B><U>minimum,  all  properties  served by the covered public water system and</U></B>
    36  <B><U>any land and any surface or underground water sources identified by  the</U></B>
    37  <B><U>department  or  department  of  environmental conservation as causing or</U></B>
    38  <B><U>contributing to the contamination. The department's measures may include</U></B>
    39  <B><U>installation of onsite water supplies, or the provision  of  alternative</U></B>
    40  <B><U>water supply sources.</U></B>
    41    <B><U>9.  Any owner of real property, including any owner's agent, to whom a</U></B>
    42  <B><U>covered public water system or the department has provided  notification</U></B>
    43  <B><U>of the exceedance of a notification level established pursuant to subdi-</U></B>
    44  <B><U>vision  six  of  this  section,  shall take all reasonable and necessary</U></B>
    45  <B><U>steps to provide, within ten  days,  any  tenants  with  copies  of  the</U></B>
    46  <B><U>notification provided by the covered public water system, or the commis-</U></B>

    39    &#167; 40. The superintendent of financial services shall  establish  rates
    40  for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
    41  malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
    42  [<B><S>2017</S></B>] <B><U>2018</U></B>; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
    43  of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
    44  in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
    45  2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
    46  accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
    47  utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
    48  insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
    49  monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
    50  and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
    51  a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
    52  attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
    53  for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
    54  not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [<B><S>2017</S></B>]

     1  surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
     2  to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
     3  surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
     4  2010.  On  and  after  July  1,  1989,  the surcharge prescribed by this
     5  section shall be retained by insurers to the extent  that  they  insured
     6  physicians  and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30, [<B><S>2017</S></B>]
     7  <B><U>2018</U></B> policy periods; in the event  and  to  the  extent  physicians  and
     8  surgeons  were  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a
     9  pro rata share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall  be  remitted
    10  to  such  other  insurer  in accordance with rules and regulations to be
    11  promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
    12  and surgeons who were not insured during such policy  periods  shall  be
    13  apportioned  among  all insurers in proportion to the premium written by
    14  each insurer during such policy periods; if a physician or  surgeon  was
    15  insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
    16  during  such  policy  periods,  and  at  any time thereafter a hospital,
    17  health maintenance organization, employer or institution is  responsible
    18  for  responding in damages for liability arising out of such physician's
    19  or surgeon's practice of medicine, such responsible  entity  shall  also
    20  remit  to  such  prior  insurer the equivalent amount that would then be
    21  collected as a surcharge if the physician or surgeon  had  continued  to
    22  remain  insured  by  such  prior  insurer. In the event any insurer that
    23  provided coverage during such policy  periods  is  in  liquidation,  the
    24  property/casualty  insurance  security fund shall receive the portion of
    25  surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
    26  The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
    27  the purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The  superintendent,
    28  in  establishing  adequate  rates and in determining any projected defi-
    29  ciency pursuant to the requirements of this section  and  the  insurance
    30  law,  shall  give  substantial  weight, determined in his discretion and
    31  judgment, to the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of  any  regulations
    32  promulgated  and  laws  enacted  and the public benefit of   stabilizing
    33  malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
    34  od of time necessary for the development of  more  reliable  statistical
    35  experience  as  to  the  efficacy of such laws and regulations affecting
    36  medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
    37  1986, by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any  provision
    38  of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
    39  the  superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if such
    40  rates would be adequate when taken together with the maximum  authorized
    41  annual  surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time whether
    42  or not any such annual surcharge has been actually  imposed  as  of  the
    43  establishment of such rates.
