         7                      ACTING PRESIDENT MEGA:  We are

         9       Wilkinson from Senator Markowitz' district from

        11       New York lead us in prayer.

        12                      REVEREND SELWYN WILKINSON: My

        13       name is Reverend Selwyn Wilkinson, Our Lady of

        14       Lourdes Baptist Church.  This is my second

        15       occasion that I am visiting the Senate in

        16       Albany.

        17                      I'm about to ask God to come in

        18       our midst.  For whatever we do, we need God in

        19       our midst.  Whether you are a Jew or gentile,

        20       whether you are a Catholic or Protestant or

        21       Baptist, as it is written, it says that every

        22       knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.

        23                      I ask almighty God to come in and












1082

         1       bless this house, O Lord, I pray and make it

         2       safe by night and day.

         3                      Whether you are on the Senate or

         4       the committee or chairman of various departments

         5       be it Agriculture, Alcohol and Drug Abuse,

         6       Children and Families, Cities, Civil Service and

         7       Pensions, Codes, Economic Development and Small

         8       Business, Consumer Protection, chairmen of all

         9       these departments; Corporations, Authorities and

        10       Commissions, Education, Election, Energy,

        11       Environmental Conservation, Ethics and Finance

        12       and Health, Education, Housing Development,

        13       chairmen of various committees; Insurance,

        14       Investigation Taxation and Government

        15       Operations, Judicial, Labor; whether it be

        16       chairman of Local Government, Mental Health and

        17       Developmental Disabilities, Rules, Social

        18       Services, Tourism, Transportation and Veterans,

        19       I ask almighty God to come in and guide you in

        20       the right directions on whatever; if you are

        21       about to sign a bill, the Bill Drafting

        22       Commissions, the ideas on by-laws and becoming

        23       laws, approvals and disapprovals in the












1083

         1       Assembly, I pray almighty God that He come in

         2       our midst.

         3                      As I was asked to come and give

         4       the invocation that God will guide you in the

         5       right direction, protect our President, our

         6       Governor, our Lieutenant Governor, and all the

         7       Senators that sit; and may God bless you all

         8       from the crown of your head to the sole of your

         9       feet.  May in this assembly God bless you today,

        10       this afternoon, Almighty God, that God would

        11       bless you and guide you in the right direction

        12       in whatever you are about to do, whatever bill

        13       you are about to pass, that in our midst

        14       almighty God will be in our midst, because it is

        15       said that every knee shall bow, and every tongue

        16       shall confess that Jesus is the Lord.

        17                      May God come in at this present

        18       time to the chairman of the security to protect

        19       us from perilous and unjust people like the

        20       incident that just recently happened with the

        21       Towers.  May God protect us that the security

        22       will guide and protect those about to represent

        23       us this afternoon.












1084

         1                      Almighty God, I ask you to touch

         2       them.  Touch them individually; touch them

         3       collectively.  Bless their families; bless their

         4       wives and children, Almighty God.  For we are

         5       about, my God, to take a very serious step this

         6       afternoon to sign bills that will guide this

         7       nation into the most powerful nation on the face

         8       of the earth.

         9                      May God protect us in no other

        10       name but in Jesus' almighty name.  If I pray

        11       among you, I lift up my eyes onto the hills from

        12       whence cometh my help.  My help cometh from the

        13       Lord which made heaven and earth.  He will not

        14       suffer thy foot to be moved.  He that keepeth

        15       Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

        16                      The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord

        17       is thy shield upon the right-hand.  The sun

        18       shall not smite thee by the day nor the moon by

        19       night; the Lord shall preserve their soul; He

        20       shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in

        21       from this time forth and forever more.

        22                      I ask, the Lord is my shepherd

        23       and I shall not want; he maketh me to lie down












1085

         1       in green pastures and leads me beside the still

         2       waters.  He restoreth my soul and leads me in

         3       the path of righteousness for his name's sake.

         4       Yea, even though I walk through the valley of

         5       the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil; Thy

         6       rod and Thy staff shalt comfort me.  Thou doeth

         7       prepare a table for me in the presence of my

         8       enemies.  The Lord anointeth my head with oil

         9       that goodness and mercy shall follow each and

        10       every one of the Senators all the days of their

        11       life; and they shall dwell in the house of the

        12       Lord forever.

        13                      Almighty God, I thank You for

        14       this opportunity.  I thank You for the members

        15       of Our Lady of Lourdes and for the people that I

        16       was given this opportunity to come and bless

        17       this house of assembly in in other name but in

        18       Jesus' almighty name.

        19                      So I thank You, dear Jesus.  I

        20       thank You, dear Jesus. I thank You, dear Jesus.

        21                      ACTING PRESIDENT MEGA:  Thank

        22       you, Reverend.
