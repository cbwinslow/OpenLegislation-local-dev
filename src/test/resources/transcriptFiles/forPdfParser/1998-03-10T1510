        3                      SENATOR LIBOUS:  Thank you, Mr.

        4        President.

        5                      I'm pleased that again this piece

        6        of legislation is passing this house and we have

        7        worked for a number of years in trying to pass

        8        this legislation to make the penalties stiffer

        9        for those adults who are purchasing large

       10        quantities of alcohol and providing it to those

       11        individuals who are minors and underage.  It is
a

       12        problem that exists in every corner of our

       13        state.

       14                      Earlier today at a press

       15        conference I talked about the 17-year-old girl

       16        from Long Island who drank 17 shots of Tequila.

       17        They took her home.  She died the next morning

       18        from alcohol poisoning, or the young man in

       19        Sidney, New York, who went to a keg party, was
16

       20        years old and was found frozen to death outside

       21        of his home.

       22                      These kinds of horror stories

       23        happen every weekend in New York State.  We have

       24        pushed this bill through this house.  It has

       25        passed in many cases unanimously, and I am
asking







                                                            1521

        1        today that our colleagues in the Assembly give

        2        this a very, very serious look and urge them to

        1        205, by Senator Maltese, Senate Print 1440, an

        2        act to amend the Election Law, in relation to

        3        political committees.

        4                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Explanation.

        5                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        6        Maltese, an explanation of Calendar Number 205

        7        has been requested by Senator Leichter.

        8                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Mr. President,

        9        this is an act to amend the Election Law in

       10        relation to political committees making no

       11        expenditures.  It would not be necessary for
them

       12        to file committee filings.

       13                      The purpose of the bill is to

       14        reduce the number of filings filed by certain

       15        political committees which do not make any

       16        expenditures during a campaign.

       17                      The present law requires that all

       18        committees which participate in an election
cycle

       19        must make all the filings required for that

       20        cycle, including the 32-day pre-general filing,

       21        the 11-day pre-general filing and the 27-day

       22        post-general day filing.

       23                      Some committees which only make

       24        contributions and no expenditures on behalf of

       25        the candidates make their contributions early in







                                                            1529

        1        the year and do not participate in the election

        2        following that point.

        3                      In cases where these committees

        4        have reported their contributions during that

        5        year, there is no need for them to continue

        6        filing reports with the Boards of Election.

        7                      This law would allow the treasurer

        8        of that committee to file a form following the

        9        filing of their July 15th report indicating that

       10        all the contributions that such committee will
be

       11        making in that year had been reported on the
July

       12        15th report and that they will be making no

       13        further contributions during that year.

       14                      This bill would help alleviate the

       15        large number of reports that are received by the

       16        Board of Election which slow down the process of

       17        both making it available to the public and

       18        auditing these reports to ensure compliance with

       19        the statutes.

       20                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       21        Leichter.

       22                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Would Senator

       23        Maltese yield, please?

       24                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       25        Maltese, do you yield to a question?  The
Senator







                                                            1530

        1        yields.

        2                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, let me

        3        ask you, in those instances where a political

        4        action committee makes no expenditures directly

        5        in aid of a candidate but may spend money on

        6        issue advertising, would they still be required

        7        to file with the Board of Election under your

        8        bill?

        9                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Mr. President,

       10        under the terms of my bill, I believe they would

       11        not have to make any filing post their statement

       12        that they do not plan to aid or assist in -- a

       13        candidate in an election.

       14                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator

       15        Maltese, as you know, we're getting -- we're

       16        seeing more and more issue -

       17                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       18        Leichter, excuse me.  Are you asking the Senator

       19        to continue to yield?

       20                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Yes, I am.

       21                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       22        Maltese, do you continue to yield?

       23                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Yes.

       24                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       25        Senator continues to yield.







                                                            1531

        1                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  As you know,

        2        we're seeing more and more what's called issue

        3        advertising, which nevertheless is very much

        4        directly related to campaigns.  I mean,
candidate

        5        "X" who's, let's say taken a certain position on

        6        gun control and while you may not mention his

        7        name, if you want to support him, you may come

        8        out with an issue piece which mirrors his

        9        position on gun control.  It may not be an

       10        expenditure directly in aid of a candidate but

       11        it's certainly something I think that the public

       12        ought to know the expenditure is being made, and

       13        my question to you is, is it wise, Senator, to

       14        limit filing, to limit disclosure, to make the

       15        process more closed as your bill inevitably

       16        does?

       17                      I mean, if it was -- I could see

       18        your bill, Senator, if it said -- if it makes no

       19        expenditures, period -- no expenditures, period,

       20        I think that's fine, but I think that where you

       21        would allow expenditures still to be made in

       22        political campaigns, although they're not

       23        directly related to a candidate but they affect

       24        the election, I think the public has a right to

       25        know.







                                                            1532

        1                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Mr. President,

        2        I'm aware of the set of facts as put forth by my

        3        good colleague, Senator Leichter.

        4                      The purpose of the bill was to

        5        eliminate any of the filings pertaining to

        6        contributions that would be made in the aid

        7        election or defeat of a candidate.  Mentioning

        8        the defeat of a candidate, it would seem to me

        9        would preclude the type of expenditures that

       10        you're talking about.

       11                      The intent, of course, is to

       12        reduce the number of filings.  Your -- Senator

       13        Leichter's statement as to no expenditures is

       14        something that I seriously think should also be

       15        passed, and I would expect that this is
something

       16        that perhaps we can end up agreeing on.

       17                      In the meantime, this particular

       18        bill, the intent is clear.  Aid or take part in

       19        the election or defeat of a candidate, and it

       20        would seem to me that an -- based on case law,
it

       21        would only be those expenditures that would be

       22        within the purview of aiding or defeating a

       23        candidate.

       24                      The type of expenditure that the

       25        good Senator is speaking of, I guess would
depend







                                                            1533

        1        on the content of the advertisements and how far

        2        they go toward aiding in the victory or defeat
of

        3        a candidate.

        4                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Mr. President,

        5        if Senator Maltese would continue to yield,

        6        please.

        7                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator,

        8        do you continue to yield?

        9                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Yes.

       10                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       11        Senator continues to yield.

       12                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, the

       13        main reason you give for this bill is to lessen

       14        the burden on the Board of Election in taking in

       15        these financial filings and keeping the records.

       16                      Senator, isn't the easiest way to

       17        do it to have a computerized system, which

       18        unfortunately this house has not passed or

       19        certainly hasn't passed a bill that was similar

       20        to the one that was passed by the Assembly.  Why

       21        don't we really deal with the problem, which is

       22        that we have an antiquated Board of Elections
and

       23        a process that's totally dysfunctional?  Why

       24        don't you deal with it by putting out the bill
on

       25        computerizing the records of the Board of







                                                            1534

        1        Elections?

        2                      SENATOR MALTESE:  Mr. President, I

        3        was wondering how long it would take in this

        4        discussion for Senator Leichter to come around
to

        5        the computerization of the Boards of Election.
I

        6        believe this house did, in fact, pass a bill

        7        which dealt with the computerization of the

        8        records of the Boards of Elections and certainly

        9        we -- with the technical progress that has been

       10        made, this is something that -- hopefully if the

       11        Assembly and the Governor and the Senate would

       12        agree, it's something that's going to be done

       13        expeditiously and in the near future.

       14                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       15        Leichter.

       16                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Let me just

       17        thank my good friend for his answers which are

       18        candid and straightforward as always and let me

       19        speak on the bill.

       20                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       21        Leichter on the bill.

       22                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  This is not a

       23        bill of any great moment which maybe is enough
to

       24        damn it, because we're dealing in an area where

       25        there is such a crying need for legislation.
Our







                                                            1535

        1        campaign finance reporting system is a disgrace.

        2        We're probably -- among all the states, we're
the

        3        worst or we're near the bottom, and I look in

        4        vain for bills to come out of the Election Law

        5        Committee and when I see a bill, you know, I get

        6        all excited.  Wait a second.  Maybe this is
going

        7        to deal with soft money.  Maybe it's going to

        8        deal with computerization.  Maybe it's going to

        9        deal with campaign contribution limitations, but

       10        all we get is something that charitably I

       11        couldn't even call a molehill in dealing with
all

       12        of the problems that we have.

       13                      So, Senator Maltese -- and I

       14        realize it's an area where considering the make

       15        up of the Legislature and how we function, the

       16        committee chairman doesn't have as much latitude

       17        as I frankly wish you had because I think if you

       18        had the latitude, I think we would see some of

       19        the bills that I'm talking about, because you

       20        come from a party that was a minority party at

       21        one time and you know how the Election Law
system

       22        is set up to discriminate against independence,

       23        insurgence.  So I think that you have an

       24        understanding and a feel for the problems.

       25                      Unfortunately, you can't put out







                                                            1536

        1        some of the bills that I think are needed, but I

        2        just really call in this house to understand and

        3        appreciate the mess that our campaign finance

        4        system is in and next Monday I'm going to be

        5        moving some motions to discharge and give you
the

        6        opportunity to let the public know whether
you're

        7        for campaign finance reform or whether you want

        8        to keep this disgraceful, almost corrupt system

        9        in existence.

       10                      Having said that, I think there's

       11        reasons to vote against this bill on its own

       12        merits.  As I pointed out in the debate with

       13        Senator Maltese, we're lessening the reporting

       14        requirement.  Now, if a political action

       15        committee makes no expenditures whatsoever,
there

       16        probably is no reason to require it to make a

       17        filing, but that's not how Senator Maltese has

       18        limited that bill.

       19                      This bill states "Political action

       20        committee that doesn't spend money in support of

       21        a candidate, no expenditure will be made on

       22        behalf of any candidate in that calendar year"

       23        and if that's the case, then no filing needs to

       24        be made, but I guess a filing could be made.  In

       25        fact, as I read this, Senator Maltese -- I don't







                                                            1537

        1        know whether you directed it -- suppose you make

        2        a filing to defeat a candidate?  Suppose you
make

        3        an issue advertise, as I said, which is -- may

        4        have the purpose of helping a candidate, may
have

        5        the purpose of defeating a candidate.  It may
not

        6        under the strict language of this bill fall

        7        within the purview of what action requires that

        8        you make a filing.  I just think that's wrong.
I

        9        think we ought to have as much sunshine as

       10        possible.  I think the public has a right to
know

       11        how monies are expended by political action

       12        committees.

       13                      So I would urge everyone to vote

       14        against this bill.

       15                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       16        Secretary will read -- Senator Cook on the bill.

       17                      SENATOR COOK:  Mr. President, I'm

       18        going to support Senator Maltese's bill, but I

       19        think that Senator Leichter is flirting with a

       20        very real problem and the problem that I would

       21        cite are these phony educational committees that

       22        send mailings into our district and tell people

       23        that we have committed some awful crime by
voting

       24        for some bill which we in good conscience have

       25        supported and they have no -- they don't have to







                                                            1538

        1        answer to anybody, and I think that frankly the

        2        thing that we really ought to do is get those

        3        people who are hiding behind that shield, making

        4        believe that they're providing information to
the

        5        public and they're really trying to undermine

        6        members of the Legislature.

        7                      I think those are the ones that

        8        really ought to be brought out into the open,
but

        9        that bill isn't before us and I'm going to

       10        support this bill.

       11                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       12        Secretary will read the last section.

       13                      THE SECRETARY:  Section 2.  This

       14        act shall take effect on the first day of

       15        January.

       16                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Call the

       17        roll.

       18                      (The Secretary called the roll.)

       19                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Record the

       20        negative and announce the results.

       21                      THE SECRETARY:  Ayes 57, nays 1,

       22        Senator Leichter recorded in the negative.

       23                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The bill

       24        is passed.

       25                      Senator Holland.







                                                            1539

        1                      SENATOR HOLLAND:  Mr. President,

        2        there will be an immediate meeting of the

        3        Education Committee in Room 332 of the Capitol.

        4                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  There will

        5        be an immediate meeting of the Education

        6        Committee, an immediate meeting of the Education

        7        Committee in the Majority Conference Room, Room

        8        332.

        9                      Senator Gold, why do you rise?

       10                      SENATOR GOLD:  To say hello, Mr.

       11        President.

       12                      Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I

       13        was distracted for a moment.  Could I have

       14        unanimous consent to be recorded in the negative

       15        on the last bill so brilliantly debated by

       16        Senator Leichter?

       17                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Without

       18        objection, hearing no objection, Senator Gold

       19        will be recorded in the negative on Calendar

       20        Number 205.

       21                      The Secretary will continue to

       22        read the controversial calendar.

       23                      THE SECRETARY:  Calendar Number

       24        282, by Senator Maziarz, Senate Print 402, an
act

       25        to amend the Criminal Procedure Law, in relation







                                                            1540

        1        to plea bargains.

        2                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Explanation.

        3                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        4        Maziarz, an explanation has been requested by

        5        Senator Leichter on Calendar Number 282.

        6                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Thank you very

        7        much, Mr. President.

        8                      Mr. President, this act amends the

        9        Criminal Procedure Law to require defendants

       10        charged with a sex felony offense to enter into
a

       11        plea bargain to plea to at least a sex felony.

       12                      One of the major problems with the

       13        criminal justice system, I believe, is that

       14        defendants charged with a sex felony offense
are,

       15        for a variety of reasons, allowed to plead
guilty

       16        to a non-sex offense.  They are not treated as

       17        sex offenders.  They are not required to undergo

       18        sex offender treatment or sex offender

       19        evaluations.  They are released into the

       20        community without notification, although I

       21        believe there is a great likelihood that they

       22        will re-offend.

       23                      This law, if enacted, would place

       24        another protection on the books in favor of the

       25        victims of sexual offenses by not allowing the







                                                            1541

        1        perpetrator to cop a plea for something less
than

        2        a sexual offense.

        3                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        4        Leichter.

        5                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Mr. President,

        6        would Senator Maziarz yield, please?

        7                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Surely, Mr.

        8        President.

        9                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       10        Senator yields.

       11                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator,

       12        yesterday we passed a very similar bill that was

       13        sponsored by Senator Skelos.  Could you tell us

       14        how your bill differs from his?  Are you
covering

       15        an area that his bill didn't cover or is this

       16        something of an overlap?

       17                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  I'm not as

       18        familiar with Senator Skelos' bill as I am with

       19        this one, Senator, but I know that this one was

       20        referred to my office by the -- I believe the

       21        Attorney General's office.

       22                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       23        Leichter.

       24                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Well, Senator,

       25        yesterday we did pass a bill that I think
covered







                                                            1542

        1        much of the ground that your bill has covered
and

        2        that bill, I think had a provision in there

        3        which, I think made a lot of sense which is not

        4        in your bill, and I want to address that.

        5                      That provision is that in

        6        instances where the district attorney feels that

        7        he doesn't have sufficient evidence to proceed

        8        with an indictment based on a criminal offense -

        9        a sexual offense, that he can apply to the court

       10        and with the court's permission he can reduce
the

       11        charges.  I think I'm quoting it correctly.

       12                      My concern is -- and I want you to

       13        address that -- is that in many of these

       14        prosecutions for sexual crimes, the proof is
very

       15        hard to come.  In some instances the victims are

       16        unwilling or unable to testify because of the

       17        traumatic thing and district attorneys, knowing

       18        that they will have a very difficult time in

       19        proceeding to trial, have, therefore, entered

       20        into plea bargains in some instances where the

       21        offense charged will not involve a sexual crime

       22        because they know that unless they do that, that

       23        perpetrator is going to walk, and your bill, as
I

       24        read it, really doesn't protect the public.  It

       25        doesn't deal with those instances where a







                                                            1543

        1        district attorney feels that because of the

        2        evidence that's available to him or her, that

        3        it's necessary to reduce the charges.

        4                      Could you address that?

        5                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  I disagree,

        6        Senator Leichter.  I think that it does give the

        7        leeway to the district attorney.  I think it
just

        8        doesn't give him as much leeway and that the

        9        defendant, whose attorney, I'm sure would do the

       10        best job possible for him, is only going to have

       11        available to him this -- to plead in the area of

       12        a sexual offense.

       13                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, you

       14        know, you may say -- if you would continue to

       15        yield, please.

       16                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       17        Maziarz -

       18                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Yes, I do.

       19                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  -- do you

       20        continue to yield?  The Senator continues to

       21        yield.

       22                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, they

       23        may say it gives him the latitude, but show me

       24        where in the bill it gives him the latitude
where

       25        it has a provision similar to the one that was
in







                                                            1544

        1        Senator Skelos' bill.  Can you show that to me?

        2                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  No, Senator, I

        3        don't have Senator Skelos' bill in front of me.

        4                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Because it

        5        doesn't exist.  No, show it to me in your bill.

        6                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Senator, I think

        7        it still gives the district attorney the

        8        latitude.  It's just a more clearly defined area

        9        that they must plead to a sexual offense so that

       10        the evaluation that the defendant pleads to can

       11        -- he can be given the necessary treatment and

       12        also and most importantly for my reasoning,

       13        Senator, is that the community would be notified

       14        upon this individual's release from prison.

       15                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator -

       16                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       17        Leichter.

       18                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  -- if you would

       19        continue to yield.

       20                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  I do.

       21                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       22        community would only be advised if the person is

       23        convicted, but if you're forcing the district

       24        attorney to proceed under charges that the

       25        district attorney can't proof, you're not







                                                            1545

        1        protecting the community.  You're endangering
the

        2        community.  Isn't that a fact?

        3                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Well, no, that

        4        is not a fact.

        5                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator

        6        Maziarz, if you'll be so good as to continue to

        7        yield.

        8                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        9        Maziarz, do you continue to yield?

       10                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Yes.

       11                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       12        Senator continues to yield.

       13                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Has the

       14        District Attorney's Association supported your

       15        bill?

       16                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  No, I don't

       17        believe that -- I don't believe that they've

       18        issued a memo in support or in opposition.

       19                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  All right.  Has

       20        any district attorney come and said to you, This

       21        is a good bill.  This will strengthen my hand in

       22        dealing with sexual perpetrators?

       23                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  I did send this

       24        bill to two of the three district attorneys -

       25        two of the three counties that I represent, the







                                                            1546

        1        district attorneys who represent those counties

        2        and both of them indicated that they thought it

        3        was a good bill.

        4                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Well, then

        5        you've answered my question and I thank you.

        6                      SENATOR MAZIARZ:  Thank you.

        7                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  I believe, well

        8        intentioned as this bill is -- and all of us

        9        certainly very much are in support of efforts

       10        that would strengthen the hand of district

       11        attorneys in proceeding against people who have

       12        committed sexual crimes, but there are times
when

       13        a plea bargain is of great benefit to the

       14        public.

       15                      I happen to think that most of our

       16        elected district attorneys, if not all of them,

       17        take their job seriously, try to protect the

       18        public and they're not going to plead down a

       19        sexual offense to a non-sexual offense unless

       20        they feel there's good grounds for it, namely

       21        that they cannot proceed to prove the sexual

       22        offense, and if you force them to go to trial on

       23        the sexual offense, when the district attorneys

       24        don't have the proof because maybe the victim is

       25        unwilling or incapable of testifying, then all







                                                            1547

        1        you're doing is forcing the D.A. to go to trial

        2        in what will result in an acquittal and that

        3        perpetrator is going to walk.  It's of no
benefit

        4        whatsoever.  Plea bargaining is an important
tool

        5        in effective law enforcement.  It's effective in

        6        all sorts of crimes, including crimes of a
sexual

        7        nature.

        8                      So much well intended as this bill

        9        is, I think it will have the opposite effect.
It

       10        will actually lead to more sexual offenders
being

       11        released because you're going to force the

       12        district attorney to go to trial in situations

       13        where the D.A. is not going to be able to

       14        prevail.  I don't think you help law enforcement

       15        by tying the hands of the district attorneys in

       16        the way that you do it.

       17                      I had some other problems with the

       18        Skelos bill, but at least it recognized that

       19        problem and provided a process whereby the

       20        district attorney could go to court and say, I
am

       21        changing this particular indictment and allowing

       22        -- or allowing the defendant to plead guilty to

       23        a crime that's a non-sexual crime and to put it

       24        on the record, and that makes sense.  That

       25        protects the public.







                                                            1548

        1                      Your bill, I think does the

        2        opposite.  I'm sorry.

        3                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Is there

        4        any other Senator wishing to speak on the bill?

        5                      (There was no response.)

        6                      Hearing none, the Secretary will

        7        read the last section.

        8                      THE SECRETARY:  Section 4.  This

        9        act shall take effect on the first day of

       10        November.

       11                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Call the

       12        roll.

       13                      (The Secretary called the roll.)

       14                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Record the

       15        negatives and announce the results.

       16                      SENATOR GOLD:  Mr. President.

       17                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       18        Gold to explain his vote.

       19                      SENATOR GOLD:  Mr. President, -

       20        Mr. President, I am rising on a matter of

       21        justice.  I don't think it's fair for Senator

       22        Leichter to always be in the boat alone.  The

       23        fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that as

       24        usual, Senator Leichter makes sense and as
usual,

       25        Senator Maziarz has the right intention and we







                                                            1549

        1        just shouldn't be bullying ahead all the time.

        2                      The fact of the matter is that

        3        there are some district attorneys who have let
it

        4        be known they won't plea bargain anything and

        5        there was a big outrage in the city of New York

        6        when one district attorney said that they would

        7        do that and the bottom line is the furor went

        8        away and the D.A. runs his office.  So there's

        9        nothing to stop district attorneys in these
kinds

       10        of cases from refusing to plea bargain now past
a

       11        certain point, but if this becomes law, you're

       12        going to have situations where district
attorneys

       13        are going to have to resubmit cases to grand

       14        juries because, of course, it's the only way I

       15        guess you could get out of it and you're going
to

       16        be doubling the work of the district attorneys.

       17                      So since yesterday we did vote yes

       18        for a bill similar to this, since I have to make

       19        a choice, I would rather see the bill which
gives

       20        some discretion to the judge and on the advice -

       21        I want you to know aside from Senator Leichter,
I

       22        have researched this with one of the great

       23        authorities in the state and Senator Masiello

       24        also tells me that I should vote no on this.

       25                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator







                                                            1550

        1        Gold will be recorded in the negative.  Announce

        2        the results.

        3                      THE SECRETARY:  Those recorded in

        4        the negative on Calendar 282 are Senators Gold,

        5        Kuhl and Leichter.  Ayes 55, nays 3.

        6                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The bill

        7        is passed.

        8                      THE SECRETARY:  Calendar Number

        9        300, by Senator Nozzolio, Senate Print 177-C, an

       10        act to amend the Executive Law, the Penal Law,

       11        the Correction Law and the Mental Hygiene Law.

       12                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Explanation.

       13                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       14        Nozzolio, an explanation of Calendar Number 300

       15        has been requested by Senator Leichter.

       16                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Thank you, Mr.

       17        President.

       18                      Mr. President, my colleagues, the

       19        measure before us is called the Sex Offender

       20        Community Safety Act which is intended to

       21        declare, first of all, that the heinous and

       22        violent crimes resulting in severe emotional and

       23        physical trauma are significant and that in

       24        certain perpetrators of those crimes,

       25        unfortunately we see too much recidivism.  That







                                                            1551

        1        recidivism is something that needs to be

        2        recognized, monitored and what we achieve by
this

        3        measure is lifetime supervision of those who
have

        4        committed certain sex offenses and very violent

        5        criminal acts.

        6                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        7        Leichter.

        8                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Yeah.  Mr.

        9        President, if Senator Nozzolio would yield,

       10        please.

       11                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       12        Nozzolio, do you yield to a question from
Senator

       13        Leichter?

       14                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, Mr.

       15        President.

       16                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       17        Senator yields.

       18                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, I

       19        think it makes good sense to have lifetime
parole

       20        for those people who commit heinous offenses.  I

       21        have no problem with that.  I want to ask you

       22        some questions about whether you're supplying
the

       23        resources for it, but you and I are on the same

       24        page as far as that goes, but you've included

       25        among the offenses that are going to require







                                                            1552

        1        lifetime parole misdemeanors.  Isn't that true?

        2                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  The designated

        3        sexual offenses means any one or more of the

        4        felonies defined in Subdivision 1 of Section 3
of

        5        the bill and that the intentions here are to

        6        certainly ferret out those very serious

        7        offenses.  We're talking felonies here, Senator.

        8        I'm not sure where you extrapolated a

        9        misdemeanor.

       10                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Well, one of

       11        the offenses that you've included is

       12        imprisonment, I think it's in the third degree,

       13        which is a misdemeanor.  That would be locking
up

       14        somebody or involuntarily detaining them if the

       15        person was under the age of 17 without in any

       16        other respects harming them, that's a crime;
it's

       17        an offense, but it's a misdemeanor.

       18                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Kidnapping is a

       19        misdemeanor, Senator?  I don't believe so.

       20                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  If it's -

       21        yeah.  Let me -- just bear with me.

       22                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Particularly

       23        kidnapping of a minor, Senator?  I don't think

       24        so.

       25                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, it's







                                                            1553

        1        -- let me -- let me -- it's in those instances

        2        -- one of the provisions -- and I will find it

        3        in a minute -- not kidnapping but unlawful

        4        detention, Senator, which happens to be a

        5        misdemeanor.  Let me ask you this:  Did you

        6        intend to include misdemeanors within the

        7        provision of this section?

        8                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Senator, this

        9        bill is designed to focus our Criminal Law upon

       10        victims and as such, stated on lines 12 and 13
of

       11        page 2, that when there are kidnapping offenses

       12        and the victim of such kidnapping or related

       13        offense is less than 17 years old, yes, Senator,

       14        that that very likely leads to an individual

       15        perpetrating a sexual offense and that, yes,

       16        particularly on someone as young as underage,

       17        that that is something that we believe is

       18        appropriate.

       19                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, let's

       20        deal -- let's now deal with the specific
section.

       21                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       22        Nozzolio -- excuse me, Senator Leichter.

       23                      Senator Nozzolio, would you

       24        continue to yield?

       25                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Would you







                                                            1554

        1        continue to yield, please?

        2                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, Mr.

        3        President.

        4                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

        5        Senator continues to yield.

        6                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Now, if you

        7        take a look on page 2, line 11, one of the

        8        offenses which is included with your bill is

        9        Section 135.05.  Is that correct?

       10                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, sir.

       11                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Okay.  Let me

       12        read to you Section 135.05.  "A person is guilty

       13        of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree

       14        when he restrains another person.  Unlawful

       15        imprisonment in the second degree is a Class A

       16        misdemeanor."  That means if you lock up some

       17        18-year-old playing around, lock a 17-year-old
in

       18        a room in a school against her will, that's

       19        unlawful imprisonment in the second degree.
It's

       20        a misdemeanor, and are you saying those
offenders

       21        should then be subject to lifetime parole or

       22        lifetime -- yeah, lifetime parole?

       23                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Mr. President,

       24        I'll answer Senator Leichter this way.  If the

       25        perpetrator of that hypothetical that Senator







                                                            1555

        1        Leichter lists for us was not 18 years old but
55

        2        years old, was a male who was detaining a

        3        three-year-old or a five-year-old girl in a

        4        position of imprisonment, Senator, I think that

        5        certainly the circumstances would change

        6        dramatically in terms of the spirit provided

        7        behind your hypothetical.

        8                      As I say, Senator, we want to give

        9        prosecutors the tool and our correction system

       10        the tool to deal with those types of variables.

       11        I think it would be up to the courts, the

       12        district attorneys, to others to look at those

       13        particular instances that you reference, sir.

       14        That's what our justice system is all about.

       15        18-year-old, 17-year-old, the facts will bear
out

       16        whether or not this is appropriate for the

       17        individual convicted, sir, but I think that

       18        nonetheless, those hypotheticals that you put

       19        forward with a few age changes and a few facts

       20        changes could dramatically change the

       21        circumstance even though the conviction may only

       22        be under a statute describing a misdemeanor,
that

       23        misdemeanor could very likely lead to a felony

       24        that creates a lifetime scar on the victim of

       25        that crime.







                                                            1556

        1                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Senator, if you

        2        would be so good as to continue to yield.

        3                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        4        Nozzolio, do you continue to yield?

        5                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, Mr.

        6        President.

        7                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

        8        Senator continues to yield.

        9                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Your job and

       10        mine is to draft legislation, to make it
precise,

       11        to cover the situations that we feel require

       12        certain law enforcement actions and we're not

       13        dealing here with giving any powers to the

       14        district attorneys or prosecutors because that

       15        bill doesn't deal with it.

       16                      We are identifying for the public

       17        and for law enforcement officials those crimes

       18        that we believe are so serious and so heinous

       19        that we are now going to subject the offender to

       20        lifetime parole, and as I said to you, there are

       21        certainly some crimes -- rape is one, certain

       22        sodomy, and so on, yes, and particularly if

       23        committed on a young person, subject that

       24        offender to lifetime parole, but maybe in your

       25        zeal to write an all-encompassing bill, I'm







                                                            1557

        1        trying to point out to you that you've included

        2        offenses are that are misdemeanors.

        3                      Now, they're still offenses.  They

        4        ought to be punished, but I'm suggesting to you

        5        that it doesn't make sense to me to say that

        6        somebody who engaged in lawful imprisonment

        7        that's deemed to be a Class A misdemeanor under

        8        Section 135.05 of the Penal Law, the prosecutors

        9        determined this is a misdemeanor.  It's not a

       10        significant crime.  Now that person's going to
be

       11        subject to lifetime parole and the state is
going

       12        to be subject to the obligation, the expense of

       13        lifetime parole for somebody who was convicted
of

       14        a misdemeanor?  I'm just suggesting to you that

       15        you might want to change the bill and take out

       16        that provision because I don't think that's the

       17        nature of the crime that justice lifetime

       18        parole.

       19                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Mr. President,

       20        in final response to this concerned Senator, my

       21        reaction is certainly your comments are noted,

       22        but again, we're looking at the victim here and

       23        the victim, we're not saying someone convicted
of

       24        this crime for an individual who is other than

       25        the victim, focuses on the victim and the victim







                                                            1558

        1        under 17 years old, certainly in the
circumstance

        2        you have described, I think you could see how

        3        that conduct, dealing with an underage person,

        4        would, in fact, demonstrate certain

        5        characteristics of behavior that are not

        6        acceptable, are extremely dangerous and could

        7        very well exhibit the very tendencies that we're

        8        trying to prevent here.

        9                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  Mr. President,

       10        on the bill.  Thank you very much, Senator

       11        Nozzolio.

       12                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       13        Leichter on the bill.

       14                      SENATOR LEICHTER:  I think if

       15        we're dealing with a serious crime, if we're

       16        dealing with those sort of character traits and

       17        that sort of offense and affront to societal

       18        standards, it's not going to be a Class A

       19        misdemeanor and I'm just suggesting that it

       20        doesn't make sense to subject somebody to Class

       21        -- who's been convicted of a Class A misdemeanor

       22        to lifetime parole.  I mean, it's -- you know,
it

       23        may be popular for us to say we're going to put

       24        sexual offenders under lifetime parole, but I

       25        think you've got to distinguish between serious







                                                            1559

        1        offenses and justify that lifetime parole and

        2        those that do not.  Lifetime parole happens to
be

        3        very expensive, but I think it's an expenditure

        4        worthwhile to deal with it or apply it to those

        5        instances where a serious offense has been

        6        committed where the character of the offense,
the

        7        character of the defendant is such that there's

        8        going to be a societal benefit by having
lifetime

        9        parole.  If it's a misdemeanor, if it's locking

       10        somebody into a room for an hour which is wrong

       11        and may be a Class A misdemeanor, I wouldn't

       12        subject that person to lifetime parole and I

       13        wouldn't subject the taxpayers of the state of

       14        New York to having to pay for lifetime parole
for

       15        that individual.

       16                      I'm going to vote against the bill

       17        just because I think it's -- it's just too

       18        broadly drawn but, Senator Nozzolio, if you want

       19        to limit it to really serious offenses, that's

       20        fine.  I'll support that bill, but I'm not going

       21        to support something that I really don't think

       22        makes sense.

       23                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Is there

       24        any other Senator wishing to speak on the bill?

       25                      Senator Gold.







                                                            1560

        1                      SENATOR GOLD:  Mr. President.  Mr.

        2        President.

        3                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

        4        Gold.

        5                      SENATOR GOLD:  Thank you very

        6        much.

        7                      Would Senator Nozzolio yield to

        8        just one question?

        9                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       10        Nozzolio, do you yield to one question?

       11                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, Mr.

       12        President.

       13                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       14        Senator yields.

       15                      SENATOR GOLD:  Senator, I'm

       16        looking at a memorandum from the New York State

       17        Parole Officers Association and if I can read -

       18        and it's a very graphic looking memo.  It says

       19        "Keep parole strong.  Be tough on crime, not

       20        just sound it" and then it says "The simple fact

       21        is New Yorkers cannot afford to risk public

       22        safety by allowing dangerous felons to be

       23        released unsupervised into our community" and

       24        then it lists Senator Maltese's bill and your

       25        bill.







                                                            1561

        1                      Don't you think, Senator, that -

        2        and I'm somebody who appreciates your sincerity

        3        on this issue and I mean that very seriously,
but

        4        don't you think that we have really lost the

        5        focus here?  If the parole officers are
concerned

        6        about dangerous felons unsupervised, and you are

        7        too, don't you think we could make that little

        8        itsy-bitsy amendment that Senator Leichter is

        9        talking about so that we are not talking about

       10        misdemeanors but we are focusing on these

       11        dangerous felons?

       12                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Mr. President,

       13        in response to Senator Gold's inquiry, I don't

       14        believe that Senator Gold or Senator Leichter

       15        appreciate the fact that maybe the level of the

       16        crime is a misdemeanor.  When you discuss the

       17        unlawful imprisonment of a young child, that may

       18        exist for an hour or so in Senator Leichter's

       19        hypothetical, but I can think of countless

       20        hypotheticals where that crime would create a

       21        scar that lasts a lifetime on the victim, and I

       22        believe that this tool will help those who wish

       23        to provide the lifetime supervision that a

       24        perpetrator of a sex crime requires.  I believe

       25        that taken in isolation, that sex perpetrator is







                                                            1562

        1        likely to be convicted of a number of different

        2        offenses of which the misdemeanor violation
which

        3        Senator Leichter characterizes would be the

        4        lesser of all the offenses that a conviction

        5        would warrant.

        6                      Senator, I don't doubt your

        7        sincerity in raising this issue, but I believe

        8        the statute is appropriate as presented.

        9                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       10        Gold.

       11                      SENATOR GOLD:  Yeah.  Will the

       12        gentleman yield to just one more question?

       13                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Senator

       14        Nozzolio?

       15                      SENATOR NOZZOLIO:  Yes, Mr.

       16        President.

       17                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The

       18        Senator yields.

       19                      SENATOR GOLD:  Senator, there's no

       20        doubt that sexual offenses leave a mark no
matter

       21        what level they're at, but wouldn't you agree

       22        that all offenses leaves some kind of a mark?

       23        There's some people whose homes are broken into

       24        and it leaves a mark.  There's people whose

       25        purses get snatched and it leaves a mark.  Don't







                                                            1563

        1        you think that every criminal act leaves some

        2        kind of a mark?

        3                      My question -- and this is what

        4        I'm getting at -- is that we have in the state
of

        5        New York a sentencing structure.  We do not say

        6        that if you commit a crime in New York, you get
a

        7        death penalty.  You commit a crime in New York,

        8        you get ten years.  We have structures, because

        9        this Legislature is smart enough and the people

       10        in this room, including you and led by you, are

       11        smart enough to make distinctions and all
Senator

       12        Leichter is saying is that -- and by the way,

       13        this bill has been before us before and it
passed

       14        with a very large vote.  Maybe one of the
reasons

       15        it's not a law today is because the Assembly may

       16        be pointing out the same thing to you -- I don't

       17        know.  I'm not in those negotiations, but all

       18        Senator Leichter is saying is that -- Senator

       19        Nozzolio, I don't know whether it's your Cornell

       20        education or not, but you're on the right idea

       21        here, but you're going too far and if we made
one

       22        little cut, we would not be affecting the bad

       23        guys.  The bad guys would still be covered by

       24        your bill, but we would be cleaning out some of

       25        the system which doesn't belong there, and all







                                                            1564

        1        I'm saying to you is, you know, as Senator

        2        Marcellino is probably telling you, accept the

        3        amendment and let's make it a better bill and go

        4        from there.  It still is going to be a Nozzolio

        5        bill except maybe we can get it passed, question

        6        mark.

        7                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Any other

        8        Senator wishing to speak on the bill?

        9                      (There was no response.)

       10                      Hearing none, the Secretary will

       11        read the last section.

       12                      THE SECRETARY:  Section 11.  This

       13        act shall take effect on the first day of

       14        November.

       15                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Call the

       16        roll.

       17                      (The Secretary called the roll.)

       18                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  Record the

       19        negatives.  Announce the results.

       20                      THE SECRETARY:  Those recorded in

       21        the negative on Calendar Number 300 are Senators

       22        Leichter and Montgomery.  Ayes 57, nays 2.

       23                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  The bill

       24        is passed.

       25                      Senator Holland.







                                                            1565

        1                      SENATOR HOLLAND:  Mr. President,

        2        can we return to reports of standing committees

        3        and consider reports of the Local Governments
and

        4        Education Committees, please.

        5                      ACTING PRESIDENT KUHL:  We'll

        6        return to the order of reports of standing

        7        committees.

        8                      The Secretary will read the

        9        reports of the Education and the Local

       10        Governments Committees.

       11                      THE SECRETARY:  Senator Rath, from

       12        the Committee on Local Governments, reports:

       13                      Senate Print 461, by Senator

       14        Larkin, an act to amend the Real Property Tax
