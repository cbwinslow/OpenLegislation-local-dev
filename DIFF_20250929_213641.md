- Initialized diff log for current task.

### tools/govdata_ingest/__init__.py
- Added package initializer exporting the streaming ingestion helper.

### tools/govdata_ingest/extract_govdata.py
- Implemented streaming-aware ingestion pipeline with batch normalisation, configurable commit cadence, and default JSONB upsert handling.
- Added catalog.data.gov extractor capable of incremental pagination with optional limits and API key support.
- Enhanced CLI to honour streaming workflow without materialising the full dataset in memory.

### tools/govdata_ingest/tests/test_ingest_streaming.py
- Authored pytest coverage exercising streaming ingestion over large synthetic datasets, pre-chunked inputs, and CLI integration behaviour.
- Refined batch normalisation to respect pre-chunked iterables without mixing batches while still enforcing size limits.
- Updated streaming tests to assert commit cadence using ceiling arithmetic for precise expectations.
