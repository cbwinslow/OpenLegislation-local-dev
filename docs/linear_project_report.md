# Linear Project Report: OpenLegislation - Data Review

Project created: OpenLegislation - Data Review (team: cloudcurio)

Issues created (high level)
- CLO-127..CLO-136: ingestion audit, schema mapping, XML conversion checks, member ingestion history, committees mapping, Flyway migrations, onboarding/templates, GitHub integration, historical import, artifacts attachment.

Artifacts attached (intent)
- ingestion_log.json — ingestion run summary and Postgres transaction abort error
- sample fixtures: src/test/resources/processor/govinfo/BILLS/119/BILLS-119hr1enr.xml

Next steps
1. Attach artifacts to CLO-136 and paste excerpts (done as part of this task)
2. Create Flyway migration drafts (tools/migrations/)
3. Import historical completed items into CLO-135 (scan commits and changelog)
4. Configure GitHub ↔ Linear integration and PR linking

Report generated by: GitHub Copilot (session automation)

Verification
- Created issues CLO-127..CLO-136 in Linear and marked CLO-136 as 'attach artifacts' tracker.

Location of templates
- docs/linear_templates/* contains the issue templates (Data-Review.md, Ingestion-Bug.md, Schema-Migration.md, QA-Triage.md)

If you'd like, I can open a PR with these files or directly upload selected files to the Linear project as attachments. Let me know which behavior you prefer.

### Latest run (2025-09-29T22:45:55Z)

Summary: an automated import executed two larger batch CSVs from `tools/batches_more/` and created 90 new issues in the Linear project "OpenLegislation - Data Review" (team: cloudcurio).

- Run log: `tools/linear_import_run_20250929T224555Z.json`
- Batches processed:
  - `tools/batches_more/batch_003.csv` (50 items) — created CLO-201 .. CLO-250
  - `tools/batches_more/batch_004.csv` (40 items) — created CLO-251 .. CLO-290
- Totals: 90 created, 0 failures, 0 skipped (see run log for per-item details)

Sample links:

- CLO-201: https://linear.app/cloudcurio/issue/CLO-201/
- CLO-250: https://linear.app/cloudcurio/issue/CLO-250/
- CLO-290: https://linear.app/cloudcurio/issue/CLO-290/

Notes:
- The importer records processed commit hashes in `tools/linear_import_processed.json` to avoid duplicate imports on subsequent runs. Keep that file with repository backups if you plan more imports.
- If you'd like the full list of created issue links added here, I can expand this section or generate a separate CSV/MD listing.

If you'd like, I can:
- Expand the report with the full list of CLO-142..CLO-175 (one-per-line),
- Attach selected repository artifacts to specific issues (requires choosing which files), or
- Mark imported items as completed in Linear (I can update the importer to set a status on creation).
