State & Local Legislative Data Sources — Prioritized starting list

Start with these sources (good machine-readable data available):
- OpenStates (aggregator for states) — https://openstates.org/ (high priority)
- California Legislative Information — https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/ (has bulk data and APIs)
- Texas Legislature — https://capitol.texas.gov/ (APIs and data exports)
- Massachusetts (MA) — https://malegislature.gov/ (data / bill text)
- New Jersey — https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/ (some bulk data)
- Washington State — https://app.leg.wa.gov/ (APIs)

Local governments: very heterogeneous — prioritize major city councils with open data portals (NYC, Chicago, LA)

Recommendation: integrate OpenStates first to get normalized, multi-state coverage; build per-state adapters afterwards only where OpenStates coverage is missing or insufficient.
