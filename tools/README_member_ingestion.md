# Federal Member Data Ingestion

This directory contains tools for ingesting federal legislator data from congress.gov API into the OpenLegislation database.

## Overview

The federal member ingestion system fetches comprehensive biographical, political, and social media data for all current and historical members of Congress. This data is essential for:

- Proper bill sponsor attribution
- Member search and filtering
- Legislative analysis by party/state/district
- Social media integration
- Cross-referencing with state legislators

## Database Schema

Before running ingestion, ensure the federal member schema is applied:

```sql
-- Apply the federal member schema migration
-- File: src/main/resources/sql/migrations/V20250921.0004__federal_member_schema.sql
```

The schema includes:
- `master.federal_person` - Biographical information
- `master.federal_member` - Political information and current status
- `master.federal_member_term` - Historical terms served
- `master.federal_member_committee` - Committee assignments
- `master.federal_member_social_media` - Official social media accounts
- `master.federal_member_contact` - Contact information

## API Requirements

### Congress.gov API Key
1. Visit https://api.congress.gov/
2. Sign up for an API key
3. The API provides:
   - 1000 requests/hour (free tier)
   - 5000 requests/day
   - Rate limiting applies

### API Rate Limits
- **Current Members**: ~550 members (House + Senate)
- **Detailed Member Data**: 1 additional request per member
- **Total Requests**: ~1100 for full ingestion
- **Time Estimate**: ~30-60 minutes with rate limiting

## Quick Start

### 1. Test the System
Run a quick test with sample data:

```bash
# Test with 5 members
python3 tools/test_member_ingestion.py \
    --api-key YOUR_CONGRESS_API_KEY \
    --db-config tools/db_config.json \
    --limit 5
```

Expected output:
```
=== Federal Member Data Ingestion Test ===

Testing Congress.gov API connection...
✓ API connection successful
✓ Test tables created
Fetching 5 sample members...
✓ Retrieved 5 members
✓ Ingested: Senator Maria Cantwell
✓ Ingested: Senator Patty Murray
...

=== INGESTION RESULTS ===
Persons ingested: 5
Member records: 5

Sample members:
  Maria Cantwell - Senate WA (D)
  Patty Murray - Senate WA (D)
  ...
```

### 2. Full Production Ingestion
Ingest all current members of Congress:

```bash
# Full ingestion (requires API key)
python3 tools/ingest_federal_members.py \
    --api-key YOUR_CONGRESS_API_KEY \
    --db-config tools/db_config.json
```

## Data Coverage

### Current Members (Default)
- **House of Representatives**: 435 members
- **Senate**: 100 members
- **Total**: ~535 current members
- **Data Included**:
  - Biographical information (name, birth/death, gender)
  - Current political info (party, state, district)
  - Social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram)
  - Committee assignments
  - Contact information

### Historical Members (Optional)
The system can be extended to include historical members by modifying the API parameters.

## Data Quality & Validation

### Automatic Validation
- **Bioguide ID**: Unique identifier validation
- **Name Parsing**: Proper name component extraction
- **Party Normalization**: D/R/I standardization
- **State/District Validation**: Geographic data verification
- **Social Media URL Construction**: Platform-specific URL formatting

### Data Completeness
- **Biographical Data**: 100% coverage for current members
- **Political Data**: 100% coverage (party, state, district)
- **Social Media**: ~70-80% of members have at least one account
- **Contact Info**: Available for most members

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. API Key Issues
```
Error: API request failed for /member: 401 Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active.

#### 2. Database Connection
```
Error: Database connection failed
```
**Solution**: Check database credentials in `db_config.json`.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
```
Rate limiting: sleeping 2s
```
**Solution**: Normal behavior - the system automatically handles rate limits.

#### 4. Missing Schema
```
Error: relation "master.federal_person" does not exist
```
**Solution**: Apply the database migration first.

### Performance Tuning

#### For Large-Scale Ingestion
```bash
# Reduce API delay for faster processing (if you have higher rate limits)
# Edit the script to reduce time.sleep(0.5) to time.sleep(0.1)

# Monitor progress
tail -f /var/log/govinfo_ingest/ingestion.log
```

#### Memory Usage
- **Per Member**: ~2-5KB of data
- **Total Memory**: ~2-3MB for full ingestion
- **Database Growth**: ~50-100MB for all members and related data

## Integration with Bill Data

### Sponsor Attribution
After member ingestion, bills can properly attribute sponsors:

```sql
-- Before: Placeholder names
SELECT sponsor FROM bill WHERE bill_print_no = 'H1-119';
-- Result: "Test Representative"

-- After: Proper member data
SELECT
    b.bill_print_no,
    fp.full_name,
    fm.party,
    fm.state,
    fm.district
FROM master.bill b
JOIN master.federal_member fm ON b.sponsor_id = fm.id
JOIN master.federal_person fp ON fm.person_id = fp.id
WHERE b.bill_print_no = 'H1-119';
-- Result: "Mary Peltola, D, AK, At Large"
```

### Cross-References
- **State vs Federal**: Identify legislators who serve in both state and federal government
- **Party Analysis**: Track legislation by party affiliation
- **District Analysis**: Correlate federal and state district boundaries

## Social Media Integration

### Automatic Account Discovery
The ingestion system automatically discovers and validates official social media accounts:

- **Twitter**: @SenSchumer, @RepNancyPelosi
- **Facebook**: Official government pages
- **YouTube**: Official channels
- **Instagram**: Official accounts

### Data Structure
```sql
-- Social media accounts linked to members
SELECT
    fp.full_name,
    fmsm.platform,
    fmsm.handle,
    fmsm.url
FROM master.federal_member_social_media fmsm
JOIN master.federal_member fm ON fmsm.member_id = fm.id
JOIN master.federal_person fp ON fm.person_id = fp.id
WHERE fm.current_member = true
LIMIT 10;
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Updates
```bash
# Cron job for weekly updates
0 2 * * 1 /path/to/ingest_federal_members.py --api-key $API_KEY --db-config $DB_CONFIG
```

### Data Freshness Checks
```sql
-- Check when member data was last updated
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_members,
    MAX(updated_at) as last_update
FROM master.federal_member
WHERE current_member = true;
```

### Error Monitoring
```sql
-- Check for members with missing data
SELECT
    fp.full_name,
    fm.state,
    fm.party
FROM master.federal_member fm
JOIN master.federal_person fp ON fm.person_id = fp.id
LEFT JOIN master.federal_member_social_media fmsm ON fm.id = fmsm.member_id
WHERE fm.current_member = true
GROUP BY fp.full_name, fm.state, fm.party
HAVING COUNT(fmsm.*) = 0; -- Members with no social media
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Member Queries
```python
# Get members by state and party
def get_members_by_state_party(state, party):
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT fp.full_name, fm.district, fm.chamber
        FROM master.federal_member fm
        JOIN master.federal_person fp ON fm.person_id = fp.id
        WHERE fm.state = %s AND fm.party = %s AND fm.current_member = true
        ORDER BY fm.district
    """, (state, party))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### Committee Analysis
```python
# Find committee members
def get_committee_members(committee_code):
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT fp.full_name, fmc.position, fmc.chamber
        FROM master.federal_member_committee fmc
        JOIN master.federal_member fm ON fmc.member_id = fm.id
        JOIN master.federal_person fp ON fm.person_id = fp.id
        WHERE fmc.committee_code = %s AND fmc.congress = (
            SELECT MAX(congress) FROM master.federal_member_term
        )
        ORDER BY fmc.position, fp.last_name
    """, (committee_code,))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```
