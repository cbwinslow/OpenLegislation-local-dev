1. Add automated integration tests that mock the external APIs to validate the
   normalization schema and PostgreSQL upserts without requiring live service
   calls.
2. Introduce a shared logging configuration helper so CLI invocations emit
   consistent structured logs for observability.
3. Consider wrapping the CLI entry points with Typer or Click for improved UX
   (auto-generated help, shell completion, validation) if the toolkit grows in
   scope.
