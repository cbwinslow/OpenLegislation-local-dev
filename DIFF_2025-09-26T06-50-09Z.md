## Added
- `tools/generate_table_mapping.py` – cross references Java `SqlTable` enum with Flyway migration files and exports JSON/Markdown reports.
- `tools/bulkdata_pipeline.py` – unified downloader for Congress.gov and GovInfo XML data with optional aggregation support.
- `docs/bulkdata_ingestion_plan.md` – documentation describing workflow for schema mapping and bulk XML ingestion.

## Notes
- Scripts rely on API keys supplied via environment variables `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY` and `GOVINFO_API_KEY`.
- Both scripts create directories as needed when writing output artifacts.
