- Added the `python_port` runtime module with blueprint dataclasses and builders to support on-demand Python equivalents of the Java domain model.
- Authored generator scripts (`tools/generate_python_blueprints.py`, `tools/extract_sql_schema.py`, `tools/map_python_to_sql.py`) to translate Java classes and Flyway migrations into JSON blueprints and schema mappings.
- Enhanced `tools/bulkdata_pipeline.py` and created `tools/govinfo_ingest.py` to support parameterised GovInfo API downloads alongside legacy bulk XML aggregation.
- Documented the end-to-end workflow in `docs/python_port_workflow.md`.
