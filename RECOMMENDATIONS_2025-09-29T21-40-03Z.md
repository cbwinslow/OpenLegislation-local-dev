1. Add checksum validation (e.g., SHA-256) for both API and bulk downloads to guarantee integrity before downstream parsing.
2. Persist task execution state (last completed task id) alongside the generated plan to allow automatic resume after interruptions without re-running completed chunks.
3. Introduce parallel download pools guarded by rate-aware semaphores so that large ingestion runs complete faster while still respecting API throttling guidance.
